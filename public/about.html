<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have recently graduated from Monash university. I have done masters in IT. I have a passion for software engineering</p>

<p>I have acquired a solid foundation in software development, cloud technologies, and web development. My experiences include
  working 
  with Python, Java, cloud infrastructure (AWS), C# .NET, and front-end technologies like React JS and Bootstrap.
   I am confident that my background in technology, along with my problem-
  solving skills and eagerness to learn, will allow me to make a meaningful contribution to any team.</p>

<p>I am a problem solver and I believe it takes the hard work of everyone in the team to make a great and lasting 
  corporation. We should be working towards a common goal. That's what makes a great team stand out from a good one.</p>
